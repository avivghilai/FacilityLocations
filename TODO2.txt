- Changed the proof as following:
    - start by prooving that each lie must be on one of the players (including p0)
    - explain that each player's cost is constant C
    - show that p0 is best.
    
    maybe split the proof to a first part in which the idea is explained and you see the computations,
    and the following cases would be at the appendix (just for the completeness of the proof)
    
verify the terminology throughout the paper (thruthfull v.s SP, score vs utility ,...)
