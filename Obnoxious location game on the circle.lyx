\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a facility location game there are number of players located at different
 locations and a number of facilities needed to be located.
 Each player has a utility function based on his location and the facilities
 locations.
 A mechanism recieves the players locations and decides the facilities locations
 while trying to maximize the social welfare: the sum of the players utilities.
 The players can lie about their location in order to increase their utility.
 A mechanism is called 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
emph{Strategy-Proof}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 (SP) if each player can't increase his own utility by lying.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We consider the problem of obnoxious facility location games on the circle.
 Each player wants to be as far as possible from the facility, for example
 a garbage dump or antenna.
 We also can't take money from the players (in real life this can be because
 of ethical, legal or political reasons).
 Our goal is to characterize strategy-proof deterministic and randomized
 mechanisms and their approximation ratios.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Previous works
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While maximizing the sum of playersâ€™ utilities, if the players can be demanded
 payments, a truthful optimal mechanism is given by the Vickrey- Clarke-Groves
 (VCG) mechanism.
 But sometimes it isn't possible demanding money (e.g., in organs donation
 or in political decision making).
 researchers tried to come up with truthful but nontrivial (nondictorial)
 mechanisms without payments.
 Approximation mechanism design without money was first advocated by Procaccia
 and Tennenholts in facility location game on a real line.
 In facility location game, each agent wants to stay as close to the facility
 as possible, which means that the agentsâ€™ preferences are single peaked.
 They charactrised deterministic and randomized stategy-proof algorithms
 for the problem of one facility on the line, and showed an upper bound
 on deteministic algorithms of 2-appromixation.
 In obnoxious facility location game, playes prefer to be away from the
 facility (such as a garbage dump).
 The obnoxious facility location game with maximizing social cost objective
 function was first investigated by Cheng et al.
 They designed a deterministic group strategy-proof 3-approximation mechanism
 and a randomized group strategy-proof 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{3}{2}$
\end_inset

-approximation mechanism on a line.
 On a circle or a tree, they proposed a deterministic group strategyproof
 3-approximation mechanisms.
 Later, Ibara et al.
 proved that, in the line metric there does not exist strategy-proof mechanism
 if the range of mechanism contains more than two-facility location candidates
 and in general metric they completely characterized (group) strategy-proof
 mechanisms with exactly two candidates in the range.

\begin_layout Subsection
Our results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We investigated the deterministic and randomized mechanisms in obnoxious
 facility game on the circle.
 We show that there is no deterministic 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha-\text{appromixation}$
\end_inset

 strategy proof mechanism with 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\gneq2(\sqrt{2}-1)$
\end_inset

.
 We design a randomized strategy-proof mechanism and show that for 2 players
 it achieves a lower bound of 
\family roman

 We also show that as more players participate, the algorithm's approximation
 ratio becomes worse.

\end_inset

 We will start with the proof for 2 players.
 Lets fix player-1 at some point on the circle Ì§ and let player-2 be on
 the circle such that the distance between them is 
\begin_inset Formula $d=\frac{3-\sqrt{2}}{7}$
\end_inset

.
 We will prove that player-2 can increase his utility by telling the mechanism
 that he is located at a distance of 
\begin_inset Formula $2d$
\end_inset

 to the same direction from player-1, therfore player-2 is motivited to
 lie.
 we will call the scenerio in which both players tell the truth 
\begin_inset ERT

 and the scenerio where player-1 tells the truth and player-2 lies that

, optimal solution will be of course to put the antenna at the middle of
 the long arc Ì§ therefore it will have a social welfare of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1-d}{2}=\frac{4+\sqrt{2}}{14}$
\end_inset

.
 Notice that the optimal location on the short arc is at the middle of it,
 with a social welfare of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{d}{2}$

 If
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\gneq2(\sqrt{2}-1)$
\end_inset

 it holds that 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\frac{1-d}{2}\gneq\frac{d}{2}$
\end_inset

 It follows that any deterministic

 algorithem must place the antenna on the long arc.

 long arc and have a social welfare of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1-2d}{2}=\frac{1+2\sqrt{2}}{14}$
\end_inset

.
 The optimal social welfare on the short arc is 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 If
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\gneq2(\sqrt{2}-1)$
\end_inset

 it holds that 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\frac{1-2d}{2}\gneq d$

 Again, it follows that any deterministic

 algorithem must place the antenna on the long arc.

\begin_layout Standard
We will now make some calculations and see that the upper bound on the utility
 of player-2 in the 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
emph{truth scenerio}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is lower than the lower bound on his utility in the 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
emph{lie scenerio}
\end_layout

\end_inset

, therfore he is motivated to lie.
 In the 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
emph{truth scenerio}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 any deterministic 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha-\text{appromixation}$
\end_inset

 algorithem must place the antenna on the long arc, and not farther than
 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{(1-\alpha)(1-d)}{2}$
\end_inset

 from it's middle because the optimal location is the middle and 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{(1-\alpha)(1-d)}{2}$
\end_inset

 is the difference between the optimal social welfare and the minimal social
 welfare.
 The best location player-2 can hope for is the one closest to it's oposite
 location, that is the point at distance 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{(1-\alpha)(1-d)}{2}$
\end_inset

 from the middle of the long arc which is closest to the opposite location
 of player-2.
 This means that the utility of player-2 is at most 
\begin_inset Formula $(1-\frac{\alpha}{2})(1-d)$
\end_inset

.
 Now for the 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
emph{lie scenerio}
\end_layout

\end_inset

, any deterministic 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha-\text{optimization}$
\end_inset

 algorithem must place the antenna on the long arc, and not farther than
 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{(1-\alpha)(1-2d)}{2}$
\end_inset

 from it's middle.
 Notice that the segment of possible locations for the antenna is between
 the opposite location of player-2 and it's false location.
 Therfore the utility of player-2 is at least 
\begin_inset Formula $d+\frac{1-2d}{2}-\frac{(1-\alpha)(1-2d)}{2}=\frac{\alpha}{2}-\alpha d+d$
\end_inset

 (the distance between player-2 and his false location + the distance between
 the false location and the optimal antenna location - the maxmial distance
 of the antenna from the optimal location).
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\gneq2(\sqrt{2}-1)$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\alpha}{2}-\alpha d+d>(1-\frac{\alpha}{2})(1-d)$
\end_inset

 which means player-2 is motivated to lie and the algorithem is not strategy
 proof.
 If we have more than 2 players, the same proof holds when any other player
 is located at player-1's location.

\end_inset

 Is there a deterministic algorithm that achieves an approximation of constant
 factor? or can we prove one does not exist?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Randomized mechanisms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Coin flipping mechanism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned before, the optimal location for the facility is at the middle
 of the longest arc.
 To make this mechanism strategy proof we add the following adjustment:
 flip a fair coin and choose a random arc (either the long arc or the short
 one), then locate the facility at the middle of this arc.
 The mechanism chooses the optimal solution in probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

, and therefore is at leaset 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 appromixation.
 In the case where both of the people are located at the same spot, at probabili
ty 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 the facility would be located on their exact location and therefore we
 get a social welfare of 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

.
 That's why the appromixation ratio exactly
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Notice that this mechanism also strategy proof for 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 players when we uniformly choose a middle of a random arc, and achives
 an approximation factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{n}$
\end_inset

.
 We won't prove that the mechanism is strategy proof in this paper as we
 provide a better appromixation algorithm and prove it to be strategy proof.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Weights mechanism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This mechanism is similar to the coin flipping mechanism mentioned before,
 but the arcs aren't chosed uniformely.
 Instead, the probability to choose an arc depends on it's length.
 An arc of length 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 would be chosen at probability
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, and then the facility would be located at it's middle point.
 We need to prove it's strategy proof and analyze the appromixation factor.
 We will show that it is strategy proof for 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 player, and achives an approximation of 
\begin_inset Formula $2(\sqrt{2}-1)$
\end_inset

 for two players.

We now provide a proof that the algorithm is SP.
 This means the players can't benefit from misreporting their location.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$

 be the player location (located at the bottom of the circle for convinience),
 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}$

 the opposite location of

For each location on the circle

 the algorithm.
 Then we show that one of the arc's end points are at least as good places
 to lie as any point on the arc itself.

\begin_layout Standard
We showed that the only possible places for a lie are the players' locations.
 Now we need to show that the best location of all is 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Notice that if the player lies and says his location is 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i},\,i\ne0$
\end_inset

, then it is the same as if he didn't participate at all.
 That's because the algorithm doesn't care if more than one person is in
 the same spot, because the 
\emph on
Social Welfare
\emph default
 function is based only on the minimum distance, and not the sum of distances,
 for example.
 Therefore, there exists some constant 
\begin_inset Formula $C=u_{0,\hat{p_{0}}=p_{i}}$
\end_inset

 for every 
\begin_inset Formula $i\ne0$
\end_inset

.
 We just need to show that 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{0,\hat{p_{0}}=p_{0}}>C$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice case 3 and 4 are the only two cases where the player could say his
 location is his real location.
 In those cases, if the player said his location is 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}$
\end_inset

, his utility would be 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

.
 using the notations of those cases and assuming the arc 
\begin_inset Formula $(p_{1},p_{2})$
\end_inset

 was chosen, his utility would be 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{3}-\frac{d_{2}}{2}$
\end_inset

.
 In addition, if the player hadn't lie his utility would be 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{d_{3}^{2}}{d_{2}}-d_{3}+\frac{d_{2}}{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Let's see the difference between these values:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u_{0,\hat{p_{0}}=p_{0}}-C=\frac{d_{3}^{2}}{d_{2}}-d_{3}+\frac{d_{2}}{2}-(d_{3}-\frac{d_{2}}{2})=

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We showed the only possible places for a misreported location are the players'
 locations, and in each of them the value is a constant 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

.
 We also showed that the utility if the player doesn't lie is larger than
 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 Therefore, the algorithm is

Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We considered the mechanisms that solve the problem of obnoxious facility
 location games on the circle without using money.
 We have showen an upper bound of 
\begin_inset Formula $2(\sqrt{2}-1)$
\end_inset

 on the approximation factor of deterministic mechanisms.
 The question wheter there is a deterministic mechanisms that ahives a constant
 approximation factor remains unanswered, we belive that there is no such
 mechanism.
 Later, we presented a strategy-proof random mechanism and proved that it
 is a 
\begin_inset Formula $2(\sqrt{2}-1)-approximation$
\end_inset

 when there are only 2 players.
 Another question is what upper bound applies to random mechanisms? We think
 that the proof of the upper bound for deterministic mechanisms can be adjusted
 to random mechanisms as well.

 We'll split the proof for this case into two subcases:

 The equation is a U-shape parabola, which means the maximum values are

 Let's check the utility:
